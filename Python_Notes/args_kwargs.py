#Args: The special syntax *args in function definitions in python is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. It is used to pass a non-key worded, variable-length argument list. 
'''
- The syntax is to use the symbol * to take in a variable number of arguments; by convention, it is often used with the word args.
- What *args allows you to do is take in more arguments than the number of formal arguments that you previously defined. 
- With *args, any number of extra arguments can be tacked on to your current formal parameters (including zero extra arguments).
- For example : we want to make a multiply function that takes any number of arguments and able to multiply them all together. It can be done using *args.
- Using the *, the variable that we associate with the * becomes an iterable meaning you can do things like iterate over it, run some higher-order functions such as map and filter, etc.

#Basic function with *args
def basic (*args): 
    for arg in args: 
        print(arg)

basic('Hello', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'Henry')

#Function with an extra argument
def extra (argument, *args):
    print('Extra argument:', argument)
    for arg in args: 
        print('*args arguments:', arg)

extra('Hello', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'Henry')

#**kwargs: The special syntax **kwargs in function definitions in python is used to pass a keyworded, variable-length argument list. 
#          We use the name kwargs with the double star. The reason is because the double star allows us to pass through keyword arguments (and any number of them).
'''
- A keyword argument is where you provide a name to the variable as you pass it into the function.
- One can think of the kwargs as being a dictionary that maps each keyword to the value that we pass alongside it. 
- That is why when we iterate over the kwargs there doesnâ€™t seem to be any order in which they were printed out.
