#In python, there's no need to declare data type, and no need to add semicolons (;) at the end of each line
#Python operations: +, -, *, // (divide and take integer), / (divide and take float), % (divide and take remainder)
#More operations: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
#Python does not have the operators ++ and -- (what a bummer)
#Python does not use && || !. Instead, we use and or not.
